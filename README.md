Hello! I want to share with you this Application I’ve made at #soyhenry bootcamp. The main idea of this project was to create an app applying all the concepts we’ve learned, get use to the GIT’s workflow and build it with the following technologies:

Backend & Data Base:
#NodeJs
#Express
#Sequelize
#Postgres
Frontend
#React 
#Redux
#HTML
#CSS
Programming Language:
#Javascript
