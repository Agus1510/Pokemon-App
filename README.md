Hello! I want to share with you my Application where you can filter Pokemons by type, sort alphabetically and by Strenght, in addition you can see the details of each one and create new Pokemons. The main idea of this project was to create an app applying all the concepts we’ve learned at #SoyHenry, get use to the GIT’s workflow and build it with the following technologies:

Backend & Data Base:
#NodeJs
#Express
#Sequelize
#Postgres
Frontend
#React 
#Redux
#HTML
#CSS
Programming Language:
#Javascript
